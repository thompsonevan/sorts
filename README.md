trying to understand sorting algorithims like selection(brute), merge, and bubble.

# TODO:
* make visualizer, specifially for selection

# Selection (Brute) Sort:
O(n^2) for average, worst, and best cases
However it is still very slow on large datasets and is considered less effiecent then insertion sort

# Insertion Sort
